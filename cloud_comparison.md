3. **Cloud-Specific Extensions**:
   - **AWS Toolkit**: Manage and deploy applications to AWS services like Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB.
   - **Azure Tools**: Build, test, and deploy to Azure App Services, Functions, and Kubernetes.
   - **Google Cloud Code**: Integrates with GCP services for deploying and debugging.
4. **Real-Time Collaboration**:
   - **Live Share**: Enables real-time collaboration on code with team members, even allowing debugging sessions.
5. **Cloud Database Tools**:
   - Extensions like SQLTools provide database management for cloud-hosted databases.

#### Cons:

### Recommendation

- **Choose PyCharm if**:
  - You need a professional-grade, integrated solution with advanced cloud database tools, remote debugging, and Docker/Kubernetes support.
  - You’re willing to pay for the Professional Edition to unlock its full potential.
  
- **Choose VS Code if**:
  - You prefer a lightweight, customizable, and free option.
  - You work across multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) and want flexibility through extensions.
  - You want real-time collaboration tools like Live Share or GitHub Codespaces for seamless teamwork.

For cost-efficiency and flexibility, VS Code often wins. For out-of-the-box integration and a polished experience, PyCharm is an excellent choice.
